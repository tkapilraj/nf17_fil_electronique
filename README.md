In the context of the course Data bases design (NF17) taught at Université de Technologie de Compiègne (UTC), we have completed a Data bases design project. This project was composed of two parts: 
1. We have made an analysis report modeling the whole problem (project plan, conceptual data model in UML and normalized logical data model).
2. We have implemented the project of another team. This part is inside this repository. Technologies: Linux / Apache / PostgreSQL / PHP (LAPP architecture), SQL, triggers, HTML5, CSS3 and Git.
